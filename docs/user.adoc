This is the primary operator for OpenStack. It is a "meta" operator, meaning it
serves to coordinate the other operators for OpenStack by watching and configuring
their CustomResources (CRs). Additionally installing this operator will automatically
install all required operator dependencies for installing/managing OpenStack.

== Description

This project is built, modeled, and maintained with https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk[operator-sdk].

== Getting Started

You'll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use https://sigs.k8s.io/kind[KIND] to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
*Note:* Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

=== Running on the cluster

. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

[,sh]
----
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
----

. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

[,sh]
----
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/openstack-operator:tag
----

. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

[,sh]
----
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/openstack-operator:tag
----

=== Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

[,sh]
----
make uninstall
----

=== Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

[,sh]
----
make undeploy
----

=== Building your own bundle, index images

The OpenStack operator uses multiple bundles to minimize the number of
deployment artifacts we have in the OLM catalog while also providing enough
space for our CRs (this is a big project). As such the build order for local
bundles is a bit different than normal.

. Run make:bundle. This pins down dependencies to version used in the go.mod and
 and also string replaces the URL for any dependant bundles (storage, etc) that
 we will build below. Additionally a dependency.yaml is added to the generated bundle
 so that we require any dependencies. This sets the stage for everything below.

[,sh]
----
make bundle
----

. Run dep-bundle-build-push. This creates any _dependency_ bundles required by this project.
It builds and pushes them to a registry as this is required to be able to build the main
bundle.

[,sh]
----
make dep-bundle-build-push
----

. Run bundle-build. This will execute podman to build the custom-bundle.Dockerfile.

[,sh]
----
make bundle-build
----

. Run bundle-push. This pushes the resulting bundle image to the registry.

[,sh]
----
make bundle-push
----

. Run catalog-build.  At this point you can generate your index image so that it contains both of the above bundle images. Because we use dependencies in the openstack-operator's main bundle it will
 automatically install the CSV contained in the dependant (storage, etc) bundle.

[,sh]
----
make catalog-build
----

. Run catalog-push. Push the catalog to your registry.

[,sh]
----
make catalog-push
----

=== Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

[,sh]
----
make uninstall
----

=== Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

[,sh]
----
make undeploy
----
